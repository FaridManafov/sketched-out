# Sketched Out

Sketched Out is a real-time multiplayer Pictionary-style online drawing game. Players join a room and take turns drawing while the others use the chat to guess what they drew. Sketched Out was built with React, Express, and Websockets. 




## Setup

- Clone the repo to your local machine.
- Run `npm install` in the root directory to install all required dependencies. 
- Run `npm start` to run the webpack server. 
- In another terminal, CD into the /socket_server directory  and run `node server.js` to start the socket server. 
- Visit `localhost:3000` and start playing!


## How it Works

Show off your art skills by drawing out the keyword you are provided. Everything you draw is rendered in real time to all the other players. It's like magic!


If someone can guess what you drew, you and they both get points! More points are awarded for a quick guess. 


Fight for a spot on our main leaderboard. Every time you exit a game, the points you accumulated are added to your total. Try to end up on top!
